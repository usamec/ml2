## Grading

Three projects:
* [Autograd](https://usamec.github.io/ml2/hw1) - 20% - deadline 9th March 
* Relativelly simple implementation of something exotic. - 30% - deadline end of semester
* [Final project](https://usamec.github.io/ml2/projects) aka Replication of recent paper results - 50%
  * General deadline 25th June
  * Deadline for 5th year students - around 27th May

Getting less than 50% from autograd project -> FX.
Otherwise typical grading scheme (more than 90% - A, 89% - 80% - B, ..., 59 % - 50% - E, less than 50% - FX).
